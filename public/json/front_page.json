Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Collection of personal information</strong></h2><p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you make a purchase through the Website.

Tailwind does not control Paddle or its collection or use of information. Any questions or concerns about Paddleâ€™s practices should be directed to Paddle.</p><p>Paddle provides us with certain non-personal information relating to purchases made by visitors to the Website. The non-personal information may include details of the purchase such as the date, amount paid, and product purchased. The non-personal purchase information may be linked to the Personal Information you provide to us (typically limited to your email address, as stated above). Paddle does not supply us with any of your other Personal Information such as your name, street address, or credit card information.</p><h2><strong>Managing personal information</strong></h2><p>You are able to update your Personal Information in your \"Account Settings\" on the Website. Currently this is limited to just your email address, as described above. You may also request that we delete your email address, but this will prevent you from accessing the products you have purchased from Tailwind.</p><p>When you update information, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. Some information may remain in our private records after deletion of such information from your account for a retention period. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, your rights to access, add to, and update your information cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p><p>We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.</p><h2><strong>Use and processing of collected information</strong></h2><p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used to personalize your experience; improve our Website; improve customer service; process transactions; send notification emails such as password reminders, updates, etc; and operate our Website. Non-Personal Information collected is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.</p><p>We may process Personal Information related to you if one of the following applies: (i) You have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to European data protection law; (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (ii) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p><h2><strong>Information transfer and storage</strong></h2><p>Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with us using the information provided in the Contact section.</p><h2><strong>The rights of users</strong></h2><p>You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.</p><h2><strong>The right to object to processing</strong></h2><p>Where Personal Information is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection. You must know that, however, should your Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn whether we are processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of this document.</p><h2><strong>How to exercise these rights</strong></h2><p>Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner by email at <a href=\"mailto:support@tailwindui.com\"><strong>support@tailwindui.com</strong></a>. These requests can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by the Owner as early as possible and always within one month.</p><h2><strong>Privacy of children</strong></h2><p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13.

In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do we will send you an email.</p><h2><strong>Legal disclosure</strong></h2><p>We will disclose any information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your user account and personal data will likely be among the assets transferred.</p><h2><strong>Changes and amendments</strong></h2><p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy relating to the Website at any time, effective upon posting of an updated version of this Policy on the Website. When we do we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page.
